  'protect.inChina.content.1':
    'More than 2,700 years ago, gibbons inhabited forests across many parts of China, including as far north as the Yellow River Basin, according to archaeological evidence.',
  'protect.inChina.content.2':
    'For the Chinese people, gibbons are deeply rooted in culture and history. They often appear in ancient poems and paintings, and remain a lasting symbol in our cultural memory.',
  'protect.inChina.content.3':
    'Today, however, wild gibbons can only be found in a few provinces: Yunnan, Guangxi, Hainan, and Tibet. Fewer than 1,800 individuals are left in total.',
  'protect.inChina.content.4':
    'As a flagship species of the forest, the presence of gibbons reflects the overall health of their habitat. They rely on the forest for food, and their loud calls are easily detectable, making them useful indicators for scientists. When gibbons disappear, it often means the forest is no longer healthy.',
  'protect.inChina.content.5':
    'Even more importantly, the forests where gibbons live are among the most biodiverse areas in China. Protecting gibbons helps protect many other species that share the same ecosystem, like opening an umbrella that shelters life beneath it.',

  'protect.knowledge.title': 'About Gibbons',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.1': 'What are gibbons？',
  'protect.knowledge.content.1.1':
    'Gibbons (Family: Hylobatidae) are not monkeys, but rather belong to the superfamily Hominoidea along with the four extant great ape genera (Hominidae). Together, they are called the hominoid group. As the most basal lineage of extant apes, gibbons represent our closest phylogenetic relatives after the Hominidae.',
  'protect.knowledge.content.1.2':
    'Significantly smaller than other apes, they\'re often called "lesser apes." ',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.2': 'How many gibbon species exist worldwide?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.2.1':
    'Scientists recognize 20 extant gibbon species, with 7 occurring in China. Gibbons represent the most speciose and numerous group of hominoids. ',
  'protect.knowledge.content.2.2':
    'Modern gibbons are classified into 4 distinct genera with notable morphological differences.',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.3': 'What Do Gibbons Eat?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.3.1':
    'Gibbons are primarily frugivorous, supplementing their diet with young leaves, flowers, and occasional insects. Notably, scientists have once captured footage of the western black-crested gibbon in China eating a flying squirrel.',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.4':
    'What is the family structure of gibbons like?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.4.1':
    'Gibbon groups consist of monogamous family units (2-8 individuals) defending territories of 20-100+ hectares. They exhibit intense territoriality against neighboring groups.',
  'protect.knowledge.content.4.2':
    'They exhibit intense territoriality against neighboring groups.',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.5': 'Where do Gibbons Live?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.5.1':
    'Gibbons inhabit tropical and subtropical forests across mainland and insular South and Southeast Asia. ',
  'protect.knowledge.content.5.2':
    'These arboreal specialists spend nearly their entire lives in the canopy, rarely come down to the ground.',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.6': 'How Intelligent Are Gibbons?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.6.1':
    'Though understudied, gibbons demonstrate: Mirror self-recognition with characteristic embarrassment displays (shared only with humans and great apes)',
  'protect.knowledge.content.6.2':
    'Advanced spatial memory and foraging planning enable gibbons to construct cognitive maps of fruiting tree distributions, allowing precise arrival at target trees synchronized with fruit ripening cycles.',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.7': 'How do gibbons locomote?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.7.1':
    'Gibbons predominantly employ brachiation(a specialized form of suspensory locomotion)to traverse the forest canopy using their elongated arms.',
  'protect.knowledge.content.7.2':
    'Gibbons swing through trees with remarkable speed—their most developed forelimbs among apes enable what appears like aerial movement. ',
  'protect.knowledge.content.7.3':
    'They can also walk bipedally along branches or on the ground.',
  'protect.knowledge.subtitle.8': 'Why Do Gibbons Sing?',
  'protect.knowledge.content.8.1':
    'Nearly every morning, gibbons make remarkably loud and melodious calls audible from 1-2 km away.',
  'protect.knowledge.content.8.2':
    'Vocalizations are exceptionally rare among mammals, with gibbon songs being the most complex and melodious of all terrestrial mammal species.',
  'protect.knowledge.content.8.3':
    "A typical gibbon singing bout lasts 10-30 minutes, during which their songs encode critical biological information including the vocalizer's species identity, sex, and social status.",
  'protect.knowledge.content.8.4':
    'Gibbons vocalize to announce territory boundaries and attract mates. Mated pairs often perform elaborate duets to strengthen pair bonds and maintain family cohesion. ',
  'protect.knowledge.content.8.5':
    'Their vocalizations may share homologous neural substrates with human musicality, suggesting deep evolutionary roots in auditory communication.',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.title':
    'Threats to Gibbon Survival and Reproduction',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.content.1':
    'Human encroachment into forest ecosystems, depriving the habitat that they depend on to survive.',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.content.2': 'Poaching by humans.',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.content.3':
    'Habitat fragmentation generates insular forest patches, causing dispersing gibbons to struggle in locating suitable family groups and impeding the formation of viable social groups.',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.content.4':
    'Limited gene flow between isolated gibbon groups reduces offspring fitness and lowers reproductive success.',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.content.5':
    'Extended maturation (7-8 years), long interbirth intervals, and low reproductive rates.',
  'protect.knowledge.threat.content.6':
    'Chronic underfunding in research and conservation efforts.',
  'protect.knowledge.why.title': 'Why Protect Gibbons?',
  'protect.knowledge.why.content.1':
    "Gibbons serve as flagship species and bioindicators of forest health. Their survival depends on primary forests' rich resources, and their conspicuous vocalizations make them effective sentinels of ecosystem degradation—their local extinction signals forest collapse.",
  'protect.knowledge.why.content.2':
    "Gibbons inhabit China's most biodiverse forest ecosystems, and their conservation acts as an umbrella, indirectly protecting hundreds of co-occurring species in these habitats.",
  'protect.knowledge.why.content.3':
    'Gibbons are closely related to humans, and research on their ecology, behavior, cognition and social structure provides a key to understanding our own.',
  'protect.knowledge.why.content.4':
    'In China, gibbons are our closest living relatives and hold a paramount status in traditional culture.',
  'protect.knowledge.cta.title': 'Protect Gibbons — it starts with me',

  'programs.overview.title': 'Overview',
  'programs.overview.content.1':
    'China is home to seven species of gibbons, with a total population of no more than 1,800 individuals. They survive only in small, well-preserved forest patches in Yunnan, Xizang, Guangxi, and Hainan. While most gibbon populations are under relatively strict protection within national parks and nature reserves, there are still some gibbons living outside these protected areas, in habitats that are closely connected with local communities.',
  'programs.overview.content.2':
    'To safeguard these endangered gibbons and the ecosystems they depend on, Cloud Mountain Conservation has developed a comprehensive and diverse approach, focusing on three key aspects: field research and conservation monitoring, community-based conservation, and public education and engagement.',
  'programs.overview.content.3':
    'Grounded in science, we conduct long-term field studies and monitoring to understand the population dynamics and living conditions of gibbons, providing essential data to support future conservation efforts and government decision-making. On this land, conservation cannot be separated from people — the involvement of local communities is crucial. Through initiatives such as community conservation leadership fostering, ecological public funds, English learning groups, and nature education programs, we aim to make communities the core force in protecting gibbons.',
  'programs.overview.content.4':
    'At the same time, we are committed to helping more people recognize the value of conservation. Through ongoing public outreach, volunteer programs, internship opportunities, and crowdfunding campaigns, we offer diverse ways for the public to participate in nature conservation — empowering everyone to speak up for these forests in their own way.',
  'programs.overview.content.5':
    'On this journey, science walks alongside emotion, and professionalism goes hand in hand with trust. Cloud Mountain Conservation firmly believes that the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature is a goal worth striving for.',
